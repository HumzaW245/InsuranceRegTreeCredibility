# InsuranceRegTreeCredibility
A view at actuarial credibility using regression trees. Analysis of insurance data from Sweden.


The project was completed as a project with a teammate of mine for the course Credibility at Concordia University.

A pdf of the project report is available upon request. The report is very helpful to understand the entire project but is not publicly available.

The Jupyter Notebook code is also available to explain details about the methods used.
